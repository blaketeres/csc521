Interpreter: 20/20

  Example 1 was interpreted almost correctly given the specs.
    The issue came when the type of
    example 1's output came into play. There shouldn't be any ints in the quirk
    language.
  Example 2 CORRECTLY INTERPRETED
  Example 3 had the same issue as example 1.
  Example 4 had the same issue as example 1.
  Example 5 had the same issue as example 1.

  There were no points marked down for this because you explained why you made
  these changes. This warning just comes into the realm of "what is the specifications
  vs what could be better" when programming for projects like this.

Style: 20/20

  While there were some warnings that were not in scope of what could be missed,
  they were too far and few in between to cause any serious point reduction.

  The readme is truly the most amazing part. Thank you for the wonderful
  communciation and explanations on changes within your code. If those were not
  there then points would have been detracted, but you have given a very clear
  and insightful explanation.

  Fantastic job!
